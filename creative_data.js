We had to develop a storyboard that effectively conveyed the complex concepts of cyber security and quantum computing and keep it simple enough to engage and captivate our audience. We took a crash course in the terminology and lingo of this new world and then dove right into unpacking the script and seeing how we could represent it visually in the simplest and smartest way possible.\n\nWe landed on a clean aesthetic that conveys solidity and technology and incorporated a futuristic fusion of 2D and 3D design.\n\nOnce we had finalised the design, our focus shifted to animation. Seamless transitions between scenes were crucial to maintaining a smooth flow of information. We also had to make sure that we integrated various 2D elements into the 3D sections in a creative way so that the project reads as a connected and cohesive whole.\n\nWe are incredibly proud of the end product and the exceptional team at 3rdfloor, who embraced the challenge and consistently raised the bar.\n\n#animation #infographics #artificialintelligence #quantumcomputing #technologysolutions #technology\n",

The intent of the project is to reduce production costs, reuse waste material, and reduce the environmental impact of the production process.\n\nDesign\n\nThe design is simple, minimal, and essential to optimize the use of the raw material and create a geometric product capable of fitting into any context of use. Litus is designed to meet the needs of flexibility and modularity, making it possible to create different configurations and arrangements of the elements, depending on the external environment.\n\nMaterials\n\nTravertine, used in two different colors, enriches and characterizes the product through its surface finish, highlighting the material aspect of the furniture and the porosity of the material, which gives each element elegance and uniqueness. The product also has a cylindrical vase made of corten, inserted in the appropriate space, which guarantees a perfect match with travertine enhanced by a circular detail.",

          "! commissioned by an indie band to work on an animated music video for their song which talks about the struggles faced during the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe story is set in outer space to reflect the feelings of isolation, a sense of being lost and the alienation of the character as a result of the COVID situation, a surreal, dream-like journey. The character is repeatedly encountered with an alien version of her, but is in denial and tries to escape.\n\nThe duality and conflict themes appear in how the alien version represents her future self who should accept our current reality and adapt without dwelling on the past. Always lurking in her presence looking at the girl. At the end, the character confronts her alien persona to tell her that she\u2019s ready to accept, be hopeful and anticipate the future with her.",

The current website was plagued with outdated information, the design didn\u2019t reflect the company's brand and failed to showcase their rich history. It amplified confusion rather than coherence.\n\nDesign process:\nWhen you have a number of business requirements, constraints and politics, a structured approach is required. Design thinking with a proper kick-off allowed me to define a workable process. I looked for a few precedents before delving too far into the design process. I made sure to frame a problem area, collect requirements and analyse the context of use.\n\nI started off the project by investigating internal (company) and external (users) drivers to crystallise the area of a potential solution, outlining how the website should work, but not how it should look.First things first, I spent a few workshop sessions with key stakeholders (the business) to learn about their vision for the company and figure out what they need from us. In order for us to design something worth creating for them, we needed an understanding of internal: business needs, requirements, goals; external: context, competitors and best practices.\n\nDesign:\n\u200dPutting it all together\nThe new website design features a modern and professional layout that effectively showcases the company's services and projects. The navigation has been streamlined to make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. We also added a contact form and clearly displayed the company's contact information to make it easy for potential clients to get in touch.

The first round was between June 2021 and July 2022, and I returned in May 2022 due to a company rebranding. Throughout the project, I worked closely with a team of designers, product managers, engineers, and data scientists. Our main goal was to improve the visual design and user experience, ultimately creating a revised application that met our users' needs\u200b.\n\nHere are some of the key contributions I made during this project:\n\nImproving the Information Architecture: I identified a problem with the application's information architecture that made it difficult for users to locate specific features. To resolve this, I led the effort to restructure the information and revamp the navigation system, making it more intuitive and user-friendly\u200b.\n\nIntroducing Quick Actions: I noticed that some users were neglecting important tasks related to the onboarding process. To address this, I introduced a \"Quick Actions\" page that allowed users to easily access important features and provided a to-do list for new users. This step helped to increase user engagement and ensure compliance with necessary tasks\u200b.\n\nAddressing Missing APIs: To reduce the volume of calls to our customer support team related to discrepancies in the number of APIs and wallet balances displayed on user dashboards, I implemented a modal with a five-second countdown. This feature reminded users of the environment they were logged into, which significantly reduced related customer support calls\u200b.\n\nImproving the Filter: I reworked the filter feature, which was a vital part of our application, by collapsing it into a single modal. This redesign ensured that the filter would scale successfully as the need arose\u200b.\n\nEasy Lookup: The Easy Lookup feature needed a better user experience, so I reworked the flow into a more compact and easy-to-navigate design. This feature allows businesses to look up details of their customers using regulatory IDs\u200b\u200b.\n\nRedesigning Results Display: I optimized and redesigned how results were displayed to make them easier to read or glance through, enhancing the overall user experience\u200b.\n\nTesting and Launch: Alongside my team, we ran internal tests and also some tests with a few of our existing users. After receiving positive feedback and making necessary adjustments, we launched the new UI on August 20, 2022.\n\nOverall, my contributions were pivotal in the successful redesign of the Dojah web application. My approach was grounded in a deep understanding of user needs, a thoughtful approach to problem-solving, and effective collaboration with a diverse team.",

Recognizing the inconsistencies in our design process, I collaborated with the Head of Design to develop Vo 1.0. This initial design system, which we named after our company, created a library of reusable components and helped introduce consistency in our design and engineering processes.\n\nIdentifying and Addressing System Shortcomings: After the departure of the former Head of Design, I stepped into the role and began refining Vo. It quickly became apparent that there were two significant mistakes we had made with Vo 1.0: we didn't include our front-end developers during the design phase, and we neglected to include the input of our brand designers and marketing managers. To correct these oversights, I led efforts to integrate these stakeholders into the design system process.\n\nResearch and Insight Gathering: To ensure our design system catered to the needs of all stakeholders, I initiated a research phase with our Associate Product Designer, Aderinsola. We conducted interviews with our internal teams to better understand the problems they encountered with Vo 1.0 and gathered their suggestions for improvements.\n\nSetting Goals and Crafting a New Approach for Vo 2.0: Following our research, I guided the team in setting high-level goals for Vo 2.0. We sought to build a structured and guided way to construct our products, improve design and development speed, ensure consistency for our users, and create continuity for future hires.\n\nUtilizing Figma and an Atomic Design Approach: I led the team in employing Figma for our design work and adopted an atomic approach to our design process, ensuring changes to the smallest unit could affect the larger components in a structured manner.\n\nUI Audit and Inventory: Together with two designers, two front-end engineers, and some marketing designers, we audited our existing design system and created an inventory of patterns and components used across all our products.\n\nLeading the Redesign Process and Stakeholder Involvement: As we redesigned the system, I took the lead in promoting understanding and co-ownership throughout the process, regularly presenting updates and progress reports to the wider team.\n\nRevising the Colour System: Recognizing that our colour system was too complex and inconsistent, I spearheaded the effort to simplify and standardize our colour system.\n\nImproving Typography: I identified issues with our existing typefaces, specifically their inconsistent appearance at smaller sizes. After conducting extensive research, I decided on Aeonik Pro as our primary font and Aeonik Mono as the secondary font to ensure legibility across all screen sizes.\n\nOptimizing Button Design: Finally, based on the patterns we observed in our use of buttons, I led efforts to revise our button designs in Vo 2.0, reducing the number of button sizes from three to two for simplicity and efficiency.\n\nThroughout the entire process, my primary aim was to create a more effective, efficient, and user-friendly design system that could serve as the foundation for our product development at Voyance.",
