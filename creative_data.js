          "\"Lekker\" is a local South African word that means 'pleasing or enjoyable'. I designed the branding, illustrations, icons and website for this South African website that gathers all the best local food, activity or any other deals together for all South Africans to enjoy. It needed to have a 'local flavor' to house all the best local deals and this was brought in through the iconography and the colour palette which is inspired by the South African Flag. The general feel of the site is 'fun', 'joy' and 'excitement'.",

By tailoring the visual elements to each market, we ensured effective communication of KFC Africa's value proposition and establishment of a strong regional presence.\n\nOur objective as brand designers was to create a visually compelling and culturally appropriate brand identity that resonates with African consumers, fosters brand loyalty, and supports KFC Africa's expansion into new markets.",

          'The transformation of Product Design through Art\n\nI had the privilege of collaborating with Quite Franckly studio on an exceptional project called "Made by the Mountain." The captivating product visualisation exercise combined the elegance of a well-designed mountain bike with the majestic essence and power of a genuine mountain.\n\nTo bring this vision to life, I used AI to conceptualise the Art Direction and utilised Houdini to meticulously craft the intricate rock formation. Cinema 4D was used to model, texture, light, and animated the Art Gallery scene, creating an immersive experience.\n\nBeyond its sheer beauty, the mountain bike serves a greater purpose\u2014it is an embodiment of both form and function. It\u2019s true calling lies in the mountains, where it finds its purpose and thrives. The inseparable connection between the mountain and the bike represents a pioneering approach to product design, one that transcends visual aesthetics and delves into the realm of storytelling and narrative-driven experiences.\n\nIf you\'re interested in exploring the boundaries of product design and the artistry that can emerge from the fusion of nature and technology, I invite you to delve into the world of "Made by the Mountain." Together, let\'s redefine what it means to create captivating products that transcend traditional boundaries and inspire meaningful connections.',

          "We\u2019re excited to present a project we recently created for SandboxAQ, in collaboration with ModelB.\n\nSandboxAQ aims to make a significant impact on the world through the use of AI and quantum technologies in various fields, including medicine, cybersecurity, and navigation.\n\nWe had just over 4 weeks from storyboard to final execution to deliver an animation that visually represented SandboxAQ\u2019s Security Suite, an end-to-end platform focused on cryptographic agility.\n\nWe knew from the start that this project would be challenging, and it was. We had to develop a storyboard that effectively conveyed the complex concepts of cyber security and quantum computing and keep it simple enough to engage and captivate our audience. We took a crash course in the terminology and lingo of this new world and then dove right into unpacking the script and seeing how we could represent it visually in the simplest and smartest way possible.\n\nWe landed on a clean aesthetic that conveys solidity and technology and incorporated a futuristic fusion of 2D and 3D design.\n\nOnce we had finalised the design, our focus shifted to animation. Seamless transitions between scenes were crucial to maintaining a smooth flow of information. We also had to make sure that we integrated various 2D elements into the 3D sections in a creative way so that the project reads as a connected and cohesive whole.\n\nWe are incredibly proud of the end product and the exceptional team at 3rdfloor, who embraced the challenge and consistently raised the bar.\n\n#animation #infographics #artificialintelligence #quantumcomputing #technologysolutions #technology\n",

They wanted a brand identity that reflected their commitment to innovation and quality, while standing out in a crowded market.\n\nAs the lead designer on this project, I worked closely with the client to understand their vision, mission and values. From there, I conducted research to gain insights into the industry and the competition, to develop a unique brand identity that would resonate with their target audience.\n\nI started the process by creating a mood board to capture the overall tone and aesthetics that DS Media wanted to convey. This was followed by sketching and ideation of various logo concepts, before moving onto digital design.\n\nThe final logo was a combination of bold typography and a simple, elegant symbol that could stand on its own. This was supported by a brand color palette that was bold, yet sophisticated, conveying a sense of professionalism and innovation.\n\nIn addition to the logo and color palette, I also developed other brand assets such as business cards, social media templates, and a brand style guide, to ensure consistency and cohesion across all touchpoints.\n\nThroughout the project, I used my skills in branding, typography, color theory, and graphic design, to create a brand identity that perfectly captures the essence of DS Media. The result is a unique, memorable, and effective brand identity that helps DS Media stand out in a crowded market.",

          "Geely's renowned and top-selling model, Emgrand7, has undergone a comprehensive upgrade, redefining a classic. As the Creative Lead, I played a pivotal role in devising the market strategy and producing various marketing assets across multiple channels such as websites, blogs, brochures, social media, whitepapers, videos, animations, call-to-action banners, commercials, documentaries, trade shows, events, billboard displays, and digital platforms.\n\nTo tackle the challenge of introducing the Geely brand in a market where the sale value and acceptance of Chinese automobiles had declined by as much as 20% over the years, I conducted extensive research and analysis. Drawing upon my expertise, I implemented innovative, sophisticated, and premium-style strategies to launch Geely's Emgrand7 in Nigeria. Through captivating visual narratives, incorporating videos, motion graphics, and still imagery, I crafted a series of impactful key visuals and campaign strategies. This comprehensive approach covered various aspects, including market analytics, moodboards, script treatments, direction for shots and photography, brochures, print ads, social media content, digital ads, email ads, TV commercials, documentaries, and overall campaign execution.\n\nGuiding my team, I aimed to present new stories of this iconic brand that would resonate with the audience, driving acceptance and bolstering the marketing and sales efforts. Emphasizing product appearance, repositioning, awareness, and trust-building, we successfully sold over 1,000 units of Emgrand7 within the first four months of its launch.\n\nCollaborating closely with the sales team at Mikano and 3D modelers, I oversaw VFX supervision during the shoot, enabling seamless compositing in post-production. By crafting compelling stories and visually stunning scenes, including CGI renderings of the vehicles, I ensured a captivating visual experience for the audience.\n\nThanks to my strategic visual campaigns and effective leadership, we achieved a remarkable 40% increase in ROI on the sales funnel and notable brand awareness in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThis experience taught me the invaluable lesson that conducting in-depth market research and developing comprehensive strategies based on market, product, and sales demographics is just as crucial as the design itself.",

          "Concept\n\nLitus is a modular bench with multiple configurations and is entirely made of travertine, using the waste blocks obtained during the industrial processing of the material. The intent of the project is to reduce production costs, reuse waste material, and reduce the environmental impact of the production process.\n\nDesign\n\nThe design is simple, minimal, and essential to optimize the use of the raw material and create a geometric product capable of fitting into any context of use. Litus is designed to meet the needs of flexibility and modularity, making it possible to create different configurations and arrangements of the elements, depending on the external environment.\n\nMaterials\n\nTravertine, used in two different colors, enriches and characterizes the product through its surface finish, highlighting the material aspect of the furniture and the porosity of the material, which gives each element elegance and uniqueness. The product also has a cylindrical vase made of corten, inserted in the appropriate space, which guarantees a perfect match with travertine enhanced by a circular detail.",

Why censor or limit our creativity when there is an open brief presented to peers in our industry? The meta-intro was born! It also gave an opportunity to make it a real team sport roping in most of the graphic department and promo directors to add bits and pieces of content. \nKeeping it fun, crazy, breaking the stereotypes and poking fun at ourselves as creatives all at once. \nThis video, paired with our "throw the design books out the window" style of vaporwave design for the other conference deliverables, made for a refreshing, entertaining and fun atmosphere at the event.\nWhy take it so seriously when Promax is all about letting your hair down and celebrating your hard work!\nIt was greatly received by the organisers, the delegates and the audience.',

Our task was to give people on the run an experience to remember, while establishing Smirnoff Vodka as the category leader. \n\nWhat we did... simple... we presented NKA 2.0 as a gathering of and for misfits and rascals. Playing on the natural rebellion of Nigerian youth, and their aversion to oppressive systems. \n\nMy role as an art director on its project was to bring infamy to life, disrupting the norm across different media channels. The event was hotel themed in my visual communications - a first of its kind. Using elements affiliated with hotels, chases and being wanted, I showed that this gathering was for outlaws and vagabonds.\n\nWe built so much buzz that we exceeded event capacity twice. The campaign was well received and had over 100M impressions, with engagements of nearly 10M. Infamy came to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

Geneza picked up on this important facet, choosing to reflect it in a logo that perfectly encapsulates the relationship dynamic between Consonance and its clients.\n\n\nThe Consonance logo; an important part of the brand, conveys a brand promise and identity that resonates with its name. Designed to resemble a Mobius strip, which is a perfect mathematical reflection of seamless synergy, the logo represents the perfect inter-relationship between consonance and its most important asset; its clients and their businesses. Consonance has a deep commitment to Africa; using an experienced, intellectually independent, and honest team to assess and invest in various financially, environmentally, and socially sustainable market opportunities in Africa for Africans.\nGeneza took this to heart, choosing 2 distinct color hues to symbolize this commitment to African entrepreneurs and enterprises. A vibrant Reddish-Orange synonymous with the iron-rich Sub-Saharan soil and a solid black to represents the unique African melanin-rich skin. We aptly named these eye-catching hues Consonance Clay and Consonance Black, serving as the Brand\u2019s primary colors and giving Consonance a visually appealing outlook that reflects its roots and its focus. Following this brand architecture, Geneza chose a unique Typeface; PP Neue Machina for its deep ink geometric type features perfectly suited to reflect innovation. DM sans, a low-contrast geometric sans serif design, serves as the secondary brand typeface. Both fonts together are a perfect geometric pairing.",

The character is repeatedly encountered with an alien version of her, but is in denial and tries to escape.\n\nThe duality and conflict themes appear in how the alien version represents her future self who should accept our current reality and adapt without dwelling on the past.

Boot X is entering the proof of concept phase partnering with a local grassroots football club to help them raise funds for the building of a new artificial football pitch. Although the proof of concept will focus on Football Boots, the longer-term vision is to open the platform up to list all football-based equipment and be a transferable model that can be used across different grassroots sports.\n\nOur mission is to make buying used football boots and equipment not only acceptable but a desirable thing to do as well as a fulfilling experience. We want the users of the service to feel like they are getting a good quality product from a premium brand and create something that becomes a viable alternative option to buying new. We feel this is possible following the lead of brands like Back Market and Depop that have managed to redefine this category.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nBoot X requires the design of a brand logo that will have focused usage in the early phases of this project. Boot X stock will initially only be listed on Instagram and at this proof of concept phase it is unlikely there will be any further digital touchpoints. Ideally, we would have a logomark that is usable as a watermark on the images of what is posted on Instagram and if there is any continuation of the logo mark that can form a visual language that can be overlaid on Instagram posts that would be desirable. We are also looking to pair the logo mark with a tagline and some example taglines have been included below. We would like the ability to tweak when needed as our messaging evolves and therefore this would probably be best in a font that sits alongside the core logo mark.",

The project team consisted of a diverse group of individuals, including the engineering lead, a product manager, a content writer,  Our close collaboration and effective teamwork were instrumental in ensuring the project's success.\n\nAs a researcher, my primary responsibility was to gather and analyze user insights to inform the design process. I conducted user interviews, surveys, and usability tests to gain a deep understanding of our target audience's needs, preferences, and pain points. These research activities provided valuable insights that shaped our design decisions and helped us create a user-centered product.\n\nIn collaboration with the engineering lead, we conducted brainstorming sessions to explore different technical possibilities and ensure the feasibility of our design concepts. By involving the engineering lead from the early stages, we were able to align our design ideas with technical constraints and make informed decisions that balanced both user needs and technical limitations.\n\nWorking closely with the product manager, I helped translate user requirements into clear design objectives and specifications. We identified key features and prioritized them based on user feedback and business goals. This collaboration allowed us to align our design efforts with the overall product strategy and ensure that the final design solution would meet both user expectations and business requirements.\n",

We needed to solve the problem of recruiters getting applications from applicants whose profiles don't match the job description so as to make the recruitment process faster for them, I came up with the solution of implementing a tagging system that would reflect on a particular job ad telling the user if they match the job or not, and if the user were to apply even though they don't match, their application won't be sent to the recruiter.\n\nThis solution was appreciated by both job seekers and recruiters when we conducted a closed-room usability study.

The current website was plagued with outdated information, the design didn\u2019t reflect the company's brand and failed to showcase their rich history. It amplified confusion rather than coherence.\n\nDesign process:\nWhen you have a number of business requirements, constraints and politics, a structured approach is required. Design thinking with a proper kick-off allowed me to define a workable process. I looked for a few precedents before delving too far into the design process. I made sure to frame a problem area, collect requirements and analyse the context of use.\n\nI started off the project by investigating internal (company) and external (users) drivers to crystallise the area of a potential solution, outlining how the website should work, but not how it should look.First things first, I spent a few workshop sessions with key stakeholders (the business) to learn about their vision for the company and figure out what they need from us. In order for us to design something worth creating for them, we needed an understanding of internal: business needs, requirements, goals; external: context, competitors and best practices.\n\nDesign:\n\u200dPutting it all together\nThe new website design features a modern and professional layout that effectively showcases the company's services and projects. The navigation has been streamlined to make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. We also added a contact form and clearly displayed the company's contact information to make it easy for potential clients to get in touch. After creating the wireframe and structuring the sitemap, i moved on the designing the interface.",

          "PayLater is an intermediary platform between the loan facilitation companies and individuals that are interested in Loan collection. The general idea is to create a central point of contact for the loan companies to link up with the individuals and also provide a less stressful refund breakdown based on percentage of next credit tied to any bank account with the individual's BVN.\n\nIn this regard, the individual gets to choose a percentage of amount to be deducted from their accounts after each credit (which can be 10%, 20% or 50%) subsequently until they finish paying their loan. This approach relieves the payer of the loan to pay back without thinking too much about the amount of money they have to pay at the end of the month.",

          "I played a significant role in the redesign of the Dojah web application, leading the project twice. The first round was between June 2021 and July 2022, and I returned in May 2022 due to a company rebranding. Throughout the project, I worked closely with a team of designers, product managers, engineers, and data scientists. Our main goal was to improve the visual design and user experience, ultimately creating a revised application that met our users' needs\u200b.\n\nHere are some of the key contributions I made during this project:\n\nImproving the Information Architecture: I identified a problem with the application's information architecture that made it difficult for users to locate specific features. To resolve this, I led the effort to restructure the information and revamp the navigation system, making it more intuitive and user-friendly\u200b.\n\nIntroducing Quick Actions: I noticed that some users were neglecting important tasks related to the onboarding process. To address this, I introduced a \"Quick Actions\" page that allowed users to easily access important features and provided a to-do list for new users. This step helped to increase user engagement and ensure compliance with necessary tasks\u200b.\n\nAddressing Missing APIs: To reduce the volume of calls to our customer support team related to discrepancies in the number of APIs and wallet balances displayed on user dashboards, I implemented a modal with a five-second countdown. This feature reminded users of the environment they were logged into, which significantly reduced related customer support calls\u200b.\n\nImproving the Filter: I reworked the filter feature, which was a vital part of our application, by collapsing it into a single modal. This redesign ensured that the filter would scale successfully as the need arose\u200b.\n\nEasy Lookup: The Easy Lookup feature needed a better user experience, so I reworked the flow into a more compact and easy-to-navigate design. This feature allows businesses to look up details of their customers using regulatory IDs\u200b\u200b.\n\nRedesigning Results Display: I optimized and redesigned how results were displayed to make them easier to read or glance through, enhancing the overall user experience\u200b.\n\nTesting and Launch: Alongside my team, we ran internal tests and also some tests with a few of our existing users. After receiving positive feedback and making necessary adjustments, we launched the new UI on August 20, 2022.\n\nOverall, my contributions were pivotal in the successful redesign of the Dojah web application. My approach was grounded in a deep understanding of user needs, a thoughtful approach to problem-solving, and effective collaboration with a diverse team.",

        description:
          "Establishment of Vo 1.0: When I joined Voyance as a product designer in September 2020, there was no existing design system. Recognizing the inconsistencies in our design process, I collaborated with the Head of Design to develop Vo 1.0. This initial design system, which we named after our company, created a library of reusable components and helped introduce consistency in our design and engineering processes.\n\nIdentifying and Addressing System Shortcomings: After the departure of the former Head of Design, I stepped into the role and began refining Vo. It quickly became apparent that there were two significant mistakes we had made with Vo 1.0: we didn't include our front-end developers during the design phase, and we neglected to include the input of our brand designers and marketing managers. To correct these oversights, I led efforts to integrate these stakeholders into the design system process.\n\nResearch and Insight Gathering: To ensure our design system catered to the needs of all stakeholders, I initiated a research phase with our Associate Product Designer, Aderinsola. We conducted interviews with our internal teams to better understand the problems they encountered with Vo 1.0 and gathered their suggestions for improvements.\n\nSetting Goals and Crafting a New Approach for Vo 2.0: Following our research, I guided the team in setting high-level goals for Vo 2.0. We sought to build a structured and guided way to construct our products, improve design and development speed, ensure consistency for our users, and create continuity for future hires.\n\nUtilizing Figma and an Atomic Design Approach: I led the team in employing Figma for our design work and adopted an atomic approach to our design process, ensuring changes to the smallest unit could affect the larger components in a structured manner.\n\nUI Audit and Inventory: Together with two designers, two front-end engineers, and some marketing designers, we audited our existing design system and created an inventory of patterns and components used across all our products.\n\nLeading the Redesign Process and Stakeholder Involvement: As we redesigned the system, I took the lead in promoting understanding and co-ownership throughout the process, regularly presenting updates and progress reports to the wider team.\n\nRevising the Colour System: Recognizing that our colour system was too complex and inconsistent, I spearheaded the effort to simplify and standardize our colour system.\n\nImproving Typography: I identified issues with our existing typefaces, specifically their inconsistent appearance at smaller sizes. After conducting extensive research, I decided on Aeonik Pro as our primary font and Aeonik Mono as the secondary font to ensure legibility across all screen sizes.\n\nOptimizing Button Design: Finally, based on the patterns we observed in our use of buttons, I led efforts to revise our button designs in Vo 2.0, reducing the number of button sizes from three to two for simplicity and efficiency.\n\nThroughout the entire process, my primary aim was to create a more effective, efficient, and user-friendly design system that could serve as the foundation for our product development at Voyance.",
